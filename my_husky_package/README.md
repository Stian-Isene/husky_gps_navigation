# my_husky_package
Project developed for navigating a clearpath husky using GPS coordinates.
This package is built alongside custom MBS software, and therefore calls some nodes/launch files that might be unavailable.

## Simulation:
### ``` roslaunch my_husky_package run_simulation.launch ```
Launches the Gazebo simulation. This includes a world with real-life GPS-coordinates and corresponding backdrop, and spawns a robot.

``` roslaunch my_husky_package ```
